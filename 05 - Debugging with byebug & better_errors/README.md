# Debugging with byebug & better_errors

## better_errors Challenges

1. Add [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) to your development group in your `Gemfile`
1. Make your project throw an exception.
1. BEHOLD!

## byebug Challenges

1. Rails ships with the `byebug` gem in dev and test, so ... just add the word `byebug` anywhere in your code and run it. 
1. Review [byebug's commands](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug#byebugs-commands). Here's a [byebug cheatsheet](http://fleeblewidget.co.uk/2014/05/byebug-cheatsheet/) that actually tells you what the commands do. (After Class Extra Credit: fork the byebug repo and update the README.md with what the commands actually do. Submit as pull request.)
1. Try using the command `step` or `next` to step through the Rails stack. What is the difference between these two commands?
